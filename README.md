# Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

A full-stack machine learning project that predicts telecom customer churn with actionable insights. Built with XGBoost, SHAP for model explainability, and Streamlit to simulate churn risk and business impact.

---

## What It Does

- Predicts if a customer is likely to churn
- Explains *why* using SHAP interpretability
- Estimates business cost of churn
- Simulates how much you can save by acting early

---

## Key Features

- Cleaned & engineered real-world telecom dataset
- Tuned XGBoost classifier with `scale_pos_weight` for imbalance
- SHAP-based feature insights (global + per-customer)
- Streamlit dashboard with churn simulation + expected loss
- Modularized for easy extension or API deployment

## Insights Learned

- Tenure and Monthly Charges are key drivers of churn
- Fiber optic users on monthly contracts churn significantly more
- Electronic check users have higher churn risk than other payment methods
